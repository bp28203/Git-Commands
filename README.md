### Show Remote URL
git remote show origin

### Troubleshooting
Error : 1
Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.

Above erros happens if Origin has some changes which are not Locally.
Solution
git pull origin develop   // assuming you are trying to push to develop branch
git push --set-upstream origin develop


Your Identity
The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when you’re in that project.
